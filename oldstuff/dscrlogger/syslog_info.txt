Some notes for integrating dscrlogger.pl with syslog

FILE: /etc/syslog.conf:
  *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none;local4.none	/var/log/messages
  local4.*						/var/log/local4
First line stops logging of local4 entries to main messages file
Second line directs local4 entries to their own file


FILE: /etc/logrotate.d/syslog
   /var/log/messages /var/log/secure /var/log/maillog /var/log/spooler 
          /var/log/boot.log /var/log/cron /var/log/local4 {
     sharedscripts
     postrotate
 	 /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslogd.pid 2> /dev/null` 2> /dev/null || true
	 /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/rsyslogd.pid 2> /dev/null` 2> /dev/null || true
     endscript
   }
Added local4 file to the file list (lines 1 and 2)


OR, NEW FILE: /etc/logrotate.d/local4
   /var/log/local4 {
     sharedscripts
     postrotate
 	 /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/syslogd.pid 2> /dev/null` 2> /dev/null || true
	 /bin/kill -HUP `cat /var/run/rsyslogd.pid 2> /dev/null` 2> /dev/null || true
     endscript
   }
Copied/modified from /etc/logrotate.d/syslog, doesn't require changes to original
file, but may now do a double-kill of syslog daemon


FOR SPLUNK:

assuming /opt/splunk installation

COPY FILE: /opt/splunk/etc/splunk-launch.conf from splunk-launch.conf.default,
then ADD/MODIFY:
    SPLUNK_HOME=/opt/splunk
    SPLUNK_IGNORE_SELINUX=true

sudo splunk start

http://bdgpu-login-01:8000
     admin password starts as 'changeme'
     now set to 'bluedevil'


SPLUNK CONFIG:
Could set up clients as standard syslog forwarders - just modify /etc/syslog.conf
to push local4 out to monitor node/splunk receiver.  But this could lose data if
the network goes down - no data is kept on the local machine, so blips in the
network lead to blips in the data stream.  Inside of splunk, all incoming
(forwarded) data shows up as "source=udp:514" -- host field is correct, but
it is a little misleading.

Splunk forwarders (or light forwarders) should be a better option.

Syslog forwards on port 514/udp.  Splunk forwarders use port 9997/tcp.

Packaging Instructions
======================

(1) in /tmp/rpmbuild, make link to rpmstuff/makefile
(1b) run:  make new

(2) in memrec/., do:  make tar.gz
(2b) mv ../memrec.tar.gz /tmp/rpmbuild/SOURCES/.

(3) in /tmp/rpmbuild, do:  make rpmbuild

Done!

-----

(1) ./lib/memrec/*  -->  /opt/memrec/lib/memrec

(2) ./etc/*  --> /opt/memrec/etc

(3) ./bin/*  -->  /opt/memrec/bin

(4) ./sbin/*  -->  /opt/memrec/sbin
   this includes the qloadsensor for SGE; so we'll need to change
	change the SGE config setting
		--> 'qconf -sconf' currently shows load_sensor == none

(5) ./src/ipmitool-1.8.9 (exe)  -->  /opt/memrec/sbin
	this is the older version of ipmitool since 1.8.11 doesn't work
	smoothly with Dell servers
   
(6) ./src/dump_tstat (exe)  -->  /opt/memrec/sbin
   needs to run as root (suid?)
   makefile is included, but basically does 'gcc -o $@ $<'


Everything should be under a common root.

memrec and dlogger will look in the directory Perl::$FindBin/../lib/memrec
for the perl module files.
